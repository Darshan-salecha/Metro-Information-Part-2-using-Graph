
Metro Information System Software provides the customers of metro 
services with lot of useful information that helpsin using the metro
services. Following are the different sectioms in the software and 
the information available in them.

Routes between stations-Selecting the starting and destination stations
will display the user the fare with change over stations which would be 
shortest among all the path available.

Station Information-Selecting station will gave you various useful 
information about the station like line at which lies,Timings,route
at which it lies. 

Lost and Found-This software provides the user facility to search for 
their valuables which they might have lost in any station.Also user 
can register for the product which they found in metro premisis.




This software is designed in such a manner that every functionality
is provided in an optimal way. Keeping requirement,space complexity 
and time complexity in concern optimal data structure and efficient
database is used.

DATABASE: MYSQL 5.0 is used in order to store the data and access the 
same as per requirement. In order to achieve the better time complexity
in searching operation indexing is done.

DATA STRUCTURE: Along with certain linear data structure like array,
list or array of list , Non linear data structure ie. graph is used 
in function to provide user the connectivity of station is same fashion
as in real world.

FILE HANDLING: In order to display large text file is used in project.

ALGORITHM: All the algorithm used in this project is are of optimum
time and space complexity.Project is designed in such a manner so
as to reduce the lines of code,time and space complexity and make it
more understandable.
